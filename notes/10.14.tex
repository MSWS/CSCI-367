\title{Internetworking}

\begin{document}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Host A constructs a frame with an IP datagram in its payload.
    \item Host A sends the frame to the router.
\end{enumerate}

When a router is connected to two physical networks, that router is called \emph{multi-homed}.
Similarly, it has two hardware addresses.

\section*{Internetwork Layer}
Questions to be addressed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \setlength{\itemsep}{0em} How does addressing work?
    \item How do we map addresses to physical addresses? (ARP)
    \item How are packets formatted, how are different frame sizes managed?
    \item How do routers know where to send datagrams?
    \item How are errors handled?
\end{itemize}
